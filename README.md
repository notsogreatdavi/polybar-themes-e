# polybar-themes-e

Polybar themes edited to fit my Acer Aspire 3 machine running Manjaro Linux i3 

this repo was cloned from https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes to my machine so I could conigure it the way I want.

the aim of this repo is to keep a backup of my polybar configurations and tweaks to my machine and other things that I may add up by the passing time
